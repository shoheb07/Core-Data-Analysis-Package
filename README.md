# Core-Data-Analysis-Package
MiniDF is a lightweight, pure-Python data analysis package inspired by the design principles of pandas. It provides a simple DataFrame abstraction for working with structured tabular data, especially CSV files.  The goal of MiniDF is to demonstrate how core data science tools work internally while remaining easy to understand and extend.
